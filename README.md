# Mandelbrot Project

This project is written in C# for CS480(Computer Graphics) at UNLV that displays a Mandelbrot set and allows you to zoom in by dragging with the left-click and resetting to the original image with the right click.

The Mandelbrot set consists of all of those (complex) c-values for which the corresponding orbit of 0 under x2 + c does not escape to infinity. When graphed on a plane this results in the generation of a fractal.
